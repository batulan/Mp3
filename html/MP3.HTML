Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinkin' maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on our corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"
I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year"
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on our corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me (find that you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (where on this Earth I could be)
Thinkin' maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet)
And you'll see me waiting for you on our corner of the street
'cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
(I'm not moving) and your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
(I'm not moving) thinkin' maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
(I'm not moving) and you'll see me waiting for you on our corner of the street
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.
